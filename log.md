# 100 Days Of Code - Log for mrwillbarnz

## Personal Log for my 100DaysofCode Challenge

### Day 0: February 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Discovered the challenge, prepared for battle!

- Discovered 100 Days of Code online! ![100-Days-Of-Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)
- Forked the original repo to start this challenge
- Revamped my Twitter to follow the official account and minor profile tweaks.
- Took a deep breath!
**Thoughts:** Here we go!
**Link to Work:** ![FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org/mrwillbarnz)

### Day 1: February 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 1 of FreeCodeCamp

- Started FreeCodeCamp HTML Classes!
- Worked through activities 1-10.
- Edited this progress and submitted entries for the first time!
- Learned about Project-based Permissions in Jenkins (*Link: to Jenkins Documentation*)
**Thoughts:** Really optimisitic so far, apart from forgetting that image tags don't follow the rules compared to other tags *(will update with a good example in the future)* As for Project-based security in Jenkins, very useful but can be confusing as the matrices are vertical *insert example of project-based matrix here*.

### Day 2: February 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of FreeCodeCamp

- Continued with HTML classes!
- Worked through activity 11-15.
- Learned about changes in Python 2 vs Python 3 for my current project (converting Python2 code manually).
- Discovered ![UAlbion Project](https://github.com/csinkers/ualbion), I since forked the repo and I'll investigate later.

**Thoughts:** Today I found Jenkins-Docker Continuous Integration LA lab difficult today, decided to step back and try again another day, after realising I missed out some syntax with the Jenkinsfile, and subsequent CI/Docker image creation steps. However, the Python 2 to 3 conversion was successful today, so onwards to tomorrow!

### Day 3: February 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 (Python-Modernization)

- Started modernizing more scripts from Michael Dawson's 'Python Programming For the Absolute Beginner Second Edition'
- Combed through pages 15-32 modernising the Python 2.3 script to Python 3.8.
- Majority of the scripts were straightforward.
- Took a minor detour finding the project 'Sultan' on Github for ensuring Terminal System bell packages were up-to-date, will test this in a future revision.
- Started learning Google Cloud Storage Provisions on LA.

**Thoughts:** Today I found setting up VSCode easy and straightforward, however I did have issues with pyenvs, hopefully I can resolve this as I progress.

**Link to work:** *Ongoing Github Repo yet to be released*

### Day 4: February 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress:**
Today I progressed through Chapter 2 of 'Python for the Absolute Beginner' and added if-else example scripts to the repo.

**Thoughts:** Learned more about the nuances between Python2 and Python3 by continuing with this exercise.

**Link to work:** *Ongoing Github Repo yet to be released*

### Day 5: February 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Today I caught up with my Google Cloud Platform course and ploughed on with the Python Modernisation. Diagnosed compilation of a C# application (Specifically ualbion on Github, a cool port of the game Albion. ![UAlbion -Project](https://github.com/csinkers/ualbion) using an Arch Linux Vagrant VM, deployed on my Manjaro Linux PC. I also continued on with the Python Modernization, I'm releasing it today so people can see my progress!

**Thoughts:** I made some really good progress with diagnosing the Arch Linux compilation package, to see more on this, I posted the original issue below.

**Link to work:**  The ualbion Arch Linux issue:![UAlbion Issue #1](https://github.com/csinkers/ualbion/issues/1)

### Day 6: February 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress** Today I contributed to a couple of 'first-timer-only' repos, to practice Git pull-ing and my first commits on the site! Pymodern is now published on Github (Will post the shortened links on twitter FYI).

**Thoughts:** Alot of discovery today, along with a really useful couple of repos I found for use, will link to them down below, very easy to demonstrate Git-pulling and other useful articles in the second one, might contribute to this one later on in the challenge!

### Day 7: February 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress** Today I contributed to one more 'first-time-only' repo example, specifically the ![FirstContributions_Repo](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions), following the interactive activity to demonstrate how a pull request works (and a tiny bit of JavaScript!). Started to tidy-up my R-code repo, and consolidate my old scripts from my Undergrad days, ideally turning them into smaller modules, that can be called upon without running specific lines. Will upload the public repo once I've found all my old code, and written some pseudocode for the mini-project.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed understanding the Git Pull Request process, will have to spend the next couple of days reviewing what I've done so far. I'm intending to building more GUI apps by the time I've finished the challenge, but slow and steady wins the race!

**Links to research:** ![Git-It](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron)

### Day 8: February 14th 2020

**Today's Progress** Today I continued my Git pull request practice by using the Git-It application (link in yesterday's notes) followed the exercises as stated on the electron-app. Attempted Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) lab, broke the test servers, setup a Linode account to potentially test more server-side applications and practice server management. Added the final Chapter 4 scripts in 'PFTAB' book.

**Thoughts:** Good progress made today, but a slower day due to working harder during the week.

**Link to work:** As yesterday.

**Links to research:** None today!

### Day 9: February 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress** Today I continued my Python Modernisation progress, starting with Chapter 5 scripts. Re-attempted the CI lab on Linux Academy.

**Thoughts:**Reading further documentation will enable me to diagnose and debug the older conditional statements, and the correct Syntax for Python3.

**Links to research:**![Python3_Conditional_Statements](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_conditional_statements.php)

### Day 10: February 16th 2020

**Today's Progress** Continued with PyModern Project, took a break from previous labs, including the CI one.

**Thoughts:**I felt that I progressed really well over the past week, hoping to continue that motivation onwards.s

**Link to work:**None to report.

**Links to research:**Note to report.
### Day 11: February 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress** Continued with PyModern Project, started Puppet Quick Start, on LA.

**Thoughts:**Puppet Quick Start was difficult to configure on my own server, but easier on the labs, due to the packages being pre-installed. Configuration of CA certs was a particular hang-up. Today I learned more about Lists and Dictionaries in Python, by creating the hangman-game.py script.

**Link to work:**None to report.

**Links to research:**None to report.

### Day 12: February 18th 2020

**Today's Progress** Today I completed the Puppet Quick-Start course from LinuxAcademy! Now I can automatically deploy an nginx instance from a puppet-master server! Started the #30DaysOfCode challenge on HackerRank. Adding this as one of the sites I go to while I learn, as it physically limits the amount you can learn in one sitting (good for me, as I can't binge the course information).

**Thoughts:** I thought today was quite rewarding, however it was difficult to grasp what HackerRank is aiming for with each of the coding challenges, however the tutorials as well as extra searching online helped me solve the basic challenges.

**Links to research:** As Above.

### Day 13: February 19th, 2020)

**Today's Progress** Today I completed Chapter 6 of PFAB, and completed a Tic-Tac-Toe game with functions.

**Thoughts:** Quite please with learning functions, but I will need to catch-up with the other courses I started yesterday tomorrow, as this took longer than expected.
