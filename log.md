### Day 1: February 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 1 of FreeCodeCamp
 - Started FreeCodeCamp HTML Classes!
 - Worked through activities 1-10.
 - Edited this progress and submitted entries for the first time!
 - Learned about Project-based Permissions in Jenkins (*Link: to Jenkins Documentation*)
 
**Thoughts:** Really optimisitic so far, apart from forgetting that image tags don't follow the rules compared to other tags *(will update with a good example in the future)* As for Project-based security in Jenkins, very useful but can be confusing as the matrices are vertical.

### Day 2: February 8, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of FreeCodeCamp
- Continued with HTML classes!
- Worked through activity 11-15.
- Learned about changes in Python 2 vs Python 3 for my current project (converting Python2 code manually).
- Discovered https://github.com/csinkers/ualbion, forked repo and will investigate later.

**Thoughts:** Today I found Jenkins-Docker Continuous Integration LA lab difficult today, decided to step back and try again another day, after realising I missed out some syntax with the Jenkinsfile, and subsequent CI/Docker image creation steps. However, the Python 2 to 3 conversion was successful today, so onwards to tomorrow!
