# 100 Days Of Code - Log for mrwillbarnz

### Day 0: February 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Discovered the challenge, prepared for battle!

 - Discovered 100 Days of Code online! !(https://www.100daysofcode.com/).
 - Forked the original repo to start this challenge. 
 - Revamped my Twitter to follow the official account and minor profile tweaks.
 - Took a deep breath!
 
**Thoughts:** Here we go!

### Day 1: February 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 1 of FreeCodeCamp

 - Started FreeCodeCamp HTML Classes!
 - Worked through activities 1-10.
 - Edited this progress and submitted entries for the first time!
 - Learned about Project-based Permissions in Jenkins (*Link: to Jenkins Documentation*)
 
**Thoughts:** Really optimisitic so far, apart from forgetting that image tags don't follow the rules compared to other tags *(will update with a good example in the future)* As for Project-based security in Jenkins, very useful but can be confusing as the matrices are vertical.

**insert example of project-based matrix here**

### Day 2: February 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of FreeCodeCamp

- Continued with HTML classes!
- Worked through activity 11-15.
- Learned about changes in Python 2 vs Python 3 for my current project (converting Python2 code manually).
- Discovered !(https://github.com/csinkers/ualbion), I since forked the repo and I'll investigate later.

**Thoughts:** Today I found Jenkins-Docker Continuous Integration LA lab difficult today, decided to step back and try again another day, after realising I missed out some syntax with the Jenkinsfile, and subsequent CI/Docker image creation steps. However, the Python 2 to 3 conversion was successful today, so onwards to tomorrow!

### Day 3: February 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 (Python-Modernization)

- Started modernizing more scripts from Michael Dawson's 'Python Programming For the Absolute Beginner Second Edition'
- Combed through pages 15-32 modernising the Python 2.3 script to Python 3.8.
- Majority of the scripts were straightforward.
- Took a minor detour finding the project 'Sultan' on Github for ensuring Terminal System bell packages were up-to-date, will test this in a future revision.
- Started learning Google Cloud Storage Provisions on LA.

**Thoughts:** Today I found setting up VSCode easy and straightforward, however I did have issues with pyenvs, hopefully I can resolve this as I progress.

### Day 4: February 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress:**
Today I progressed through Chapter 2 of 'Python for the Absolute Beginner' and added if-else example scripts to the repo.

**Thoughts:** Learned more about the nuances between Python2 and Python3 by continuing with this exercise.

### Day 5: February 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Today I caught up with my Google Cloud Platform course and ploughed on with the Python Modernisation. Diagnosed compilation of a C# application (Specifically ualbion on Github, a cool port of the game Albion. !(https://github.com/csinkers/ualbion) using an Arch Linux Vagrant VM, deployed on my Manjaro Linux PC. I also continued on with the Python Modernization, I'm releasing it today so people can see my progress!

**Thoughts:** I made some really good progress with diagnosing the Arch Linux compilation package, to see more on this, I posted the original issue below.
