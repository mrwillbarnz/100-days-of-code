### Day 1: February 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 1 of FreeCodeCamp
 - Started FreeCodeCamp HTML Classes!
 - Worked through activities 1-10.
 - Edited this progress and submitted entries for the first time!
 - Learned about Project-based Permissions in Jenkins (*Link: to Jenkins Documentation*)
 
**Thoughts:** Really optimisitic so far, apart from forgetting that image tags don't follow the rules compared to other tags *(will update with a good example in the future)* As for Project-based security in Jenkins, very useful but can be confusing as the matrices are vertical.

*example of project-based matrix here*
